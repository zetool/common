 * A class that represents an implicitly given sequence of doubles, that is uniformly distributed between a start and an
 * end value, with a specified step in between two doubles. Notice that the step does not need to be an double - the
 * returned doubles are rounded values of an internal floating point number. The two boundary values are always part of
 * the returned sequence, even when starting from the first value with the specified step would normally not stop at the
 * end value. If start and end value are the same, the sequence contains just this one double.
